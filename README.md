# Transfer-Learning-on-Fashion-MNIST-using-PyTorch-GPU-
This project demonstrates the practical application of transfer learning using a pretrained VGG16 convolutional neural network on the Fashion-MNIST dataset. The focus is on data pipeline design, GPU training, and model adaptation, rather than model invention.
